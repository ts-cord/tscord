# Security policy

The Typecord library development team strives to maintain a high level of security in our code and infrastructure. However, we know that no application can be completely secure, so we encourage our community to report any security issues they encounter.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a vulnerability in our library, we ask that you report it immediately by our dev **Unreal#0506** in Discord with full details of the issue.

Our security team will assess the vulnerability and work with the development team to implement a solution. We'll do our best to respond to all security reports as quickly as possible and keep you posted on remediation progress.

## Staying Safe

We recommend that our users follow standard security practices, such as using strong passwords, two-factor authentication, and keeping software up-to-date. Also, whenever possible, use our security features such as Discord API two-step verification to ensure the safety of your bots.

We appreciate your cooperation in keeping the Typecord library safe and reliable for all our users.
